# Labs
## About
I've fallen into the trap of reading books and watching videos while trying to learn something. Taking the idea from science, 
this repo contains labs for gaining hands-on experience writing software. It contains projects, scripts, and experiments
that I use to learn and explore new languages and frameworks.

## Format
Each lab is in it's own repo and contains a README that explains what the lab is and why I decided to do it.
